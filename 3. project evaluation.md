### Evaluation of your INDIVIDUAL Final Test Case in Relation to Functional Criteria
I have designed and have created a robot that successfully used everything in the functional criteria. In manual mode, it responds to keyboard input (w, a, s, d) to move in different directions. While in autonomous mode, the robot uses the colour sensors to find and then avoid obstacles. It also responds to different coloured blocks such as red, yellow and blue. When it detects green, it spins around and shows a message from the user. The program includes mode switching between manual and autonomous navigation using the 'q' and 'm' keys. I also used  visual (screen text) and sounds (beeps) for the user.

### Evaluation of your INDIVIDUAL Final Test Case in Relation to Non-Functional Criteria
I made sure the robot was responsive, reliable at detecting things and could work in real-life conditions. Switching between manual and automatic modes was quick and didn’t slow anything down. I placed the obstacle and colour detection checks in correct spots in the code so the robot was always looking out for changes. It could tell colours apart well in good lighting, but sometimes struggled to detect green in different lighting. Overall, it worked fine, but could be improved by using better sensors.

### Evaluation of your Final Performance in Relation to the Identified Need
The goal was to build a delivery-style robot that could move on its own or be manually controlled, avoid obstacles, and respond to things like colours. I managed to do all of this on my own. I created and tested both driving modes, added colour-based actions and also got the message-on-green feature working. The robot stops on green, shows the message and acts like it’s delivering something by spinning. It did mostly what I wanted except for keeping track of the EV3's route and going back to the base. In the end, it was a successful project for me as I did mostly what I wanted to do.

### Evaluation of Project in Relation to Project Management
I broke the project into smaller tasks—starting with manual control, then adding sensors. After that, I created more code making it autonomous, and finally adding mode switching. This step-by-step plan helped me test each part properly before putting them together. I also used variables to help me with bug fixing as I went. At The end, this code could be better if I split it into multiple functions, but overall, my way of working helped me finish everything I needed.

### Evaluation of Project in Relation to Team Collaboration
I did the whole project by myself, so there wasn’t any teamwork. However, if I needed help, I would either ask the teacher or my classmates.

### Identification and Evaluation of Future Improvements to your Final Product
To make the robot easier to use, I could replace the 'typed message input' with the EV3 buttons, so it works better in real-world use. I could also make the movement better by getting better sensors. Lastly, splitting the code into functions could make it easier to read and fix in the future.
