### Pseudocode 1:
    
    WHILE true get user input (char)
        IF char equals 'FORWARD_KEY' THEN
            drive forward
            check for obstacles
        ELSE IF char equals 'BACK_KEY' THEN
            drive forward
            check for obstacles
        ELSE IF char equals 'LEFT_KEY' THEN
            turn robot left
            check for obstacles
        ELSE IF char equals 'RIGHT_KEY' THEN
            Turn robot right
            Check for obstacles
        END If
    END WHILE


***

The robot checks for the user input (to move forward, backward, or turn left or right) and then it performs the  action depending on what key was pressed. After each movement, it then checks for obstacles and if it finds an obstacle, then it reverses and alerts the user.

### Pseudocode 2:
    
    WHILE true
        IF secondary color sensor detects BLACK:
            Generate a random number (1 or 2)
            IF the number is 1:
                Turn right
                Drive forward for 1 second
                Turn right again
            ELSE IF the number is 2:
                Turn left
                Drive forward for 1 second
                Turn left again

        IF main color sensor detects RED or YELLOW or BLUE:
            Stop the robot
            Turn right
            Drive forward for 1 second
            Turn left
            Drive forward for 1 second
            Turn left again

        IF main color sensor detects GREEN:
            Turn left
            Turn left
            Turn left 
            Turn left
            Display message: (what user typed)
        END If
    END WHILE


***

The robot runs continuously (as this is for the autonomous mode) while checking its 2 color sensors to react to specific colors. If the secondary sensor sees black, it randomly turns left or right by 90 degrees and drives forward; if the main sensor sees red, yellow, or blue, it stops and navigates around the area and if it sees green it spins and then displays a message of user's choice.

## Pseudocode 3:

    DEFINE checkForObstacles():
        IF secondary color sensor detects BLACK:
            Stop the robot
            Clear the screen
            Display message: "Object detected!"
            Wait for 1 second
            Beep once
            Wait for a short time
            Beep again
            Wait for a short time
            Clear the screen
            Drive backward for 1 second
        ELSE:
            Display message: "No Obstacles Detected"
            Wait for half a second
            Clear the screen
        END IF

***

The **checkForObstacles()** function checks if secondary color sensor detects BLACK. If an object is detected, the robot stops, then warns the user with messages and beeps, and then reverses. If there are no obstacles it no obstacles are present
