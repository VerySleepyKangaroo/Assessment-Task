### Code:
    def checkforobstacles():
        if color_sensor2.color() == Color.BLACK:
            robot.stop()
            ev3.screen.clear()
            ev3.screen.print("Object detected!")
            wait(1000)
            ev3.speaker.beep()
            wait(100)
            ev3.speaker.beep()
            wait(100)
            ev3.screen.clear()
            robot.drive_time(-250, 0, 1000)

    While True():
        if char == FRONT_KEY:
            ev3.screen.print("Going Forwards")
            robot.drive_time(200, 0, 1000)
            ev3.screen.clear()
            robot.stop()
            checkforobstacles()
            char = " "
        elif char == BACK_KEY:
            ev3.screen.print("Going Backwards")
            robot.drive_time(-200, 0, 1000)
            ev3.screen.clear()
            robot.stop()
            checkforobstacles()
            char = " "
        elif char == LEFT_KEY:
            ev3.screen.print("Turning Left")
            robot.turn(-50)
            ev3.screen.clear()
            robot.stop()
            checkforobstacles()
            char = " "
        elif char == RIGHT_KEY:
            ev3.screen.print("Turning Right")
            robot.turn(50)
            ev3.screen.clear()
            robot.stop()
            checkforobstacles()
            char = " "
        time.sleep(0.1)

### Results:

    Each of these keys triggers a specific movement on the robot. For 'W', the robot moves forward for 1 second, 'S' makes it go backward, 'A' causes a left turn and 'D' makes it turn right. During this time, the EV3 screen briefly displays a message like "Going Forwards", "Going Backwards", "Turning Right" or "Turning Left" and then it clears. After the movement, the robot stops and calls checkforobstacles() to detect any black surfaces with the color sensors.

    It worked perfectly

## My Second Test:

### Code:
    import sys
    import time
    import math
    import random
    from pybricks.hubs import EV3Brick
    from pybricks.ev3devices import (Motor, TouchSensor, ColorSensor,
                                 InfraredSensor, UltrasonicSensor, GyroSensor)
   
    RIGHT_KEY = 'd'
    STOP_KEY = 'q'

    obstacle_sensor = UltrasonicSensor(Port.S4)  # Ultrasonic sensor
    color_sensor = ColorSensor(Port.S3)  # Color sensor
    touch_sensor = TouchSensor(Port.S1)  # Touch sensor

    robot = DriveBase(left_motor, right_motor, wheel_diameter=55.5, axle_track=118)

    print("Click Q to make it Autonomous")

    # Write your program here.
    ev3.speaker.beep()

    def checkforobstacles():
        wait(500)
        ev3.screen.clear()

    def autonomous():
        print("Autonomous session is active")
        while True:
            ev3.screen.clear()
            ev3.screen.print("Autonomous")
            robot.drive_time(100, 0, 1000)
            if obstacle_sensor.distance() < 150:
                turn = random.randint(1, 2)
                print(color = color_sensor.color)
                if turn == 1:
                    robot.turn(100)
                    robot.drive_time(250, 0, 2000)
                    robot.turn(100)
                if turn == 2:
                    robot.turn(-100)
                    robot.drive_time(250, 0, 2000)
                    robot.turn(-100)


    while True:
        char = sys.stdin.read(1)
        if char == FRONT_KEY:
            def checkforobstacles():
            ev3.screen.clear()
            robot.stop()
            checkforobstacles()
        elif char == STOP_KEY:
            robot.stop()
            ev3.screen.print("Loading . . .")
            print("Loading . . .")
            autonomous()
            break
        elif touch_sensor.pressed():
            robot.stop()
            ev3.screen.print("Touch Sensor Pressed")
            break
        time.sleep(0.1)

### Results

    I had bugs which included the 'print(color = colour_sensor.color)' in which I attempted to find what color was being detected to no avail so I complete;y removed it. My checkforobstacles variable also did not work so I reworked the script and added 2 colour sensors (1 for the blocks and 1 for detecting the line on the ground). I also cleaned up the structure to make it easier to understand and bugfix if I need to. In summary, I made the scripts better by updating them to better handle obstacle avoidance, fixed bugs by removing them or reworking them and making the structure better.
